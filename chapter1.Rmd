## About the project

*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your GitHub repository here. This is an R Markdown (.Rmd) file so you can use R Markdown syntax.*

**How are you feeling right now?**

*Feeling well, maybe a bit tired as it is already sunday evening. Just finished the datacamp trainings which were actually quite fun.*

**What do you expect to learn?** 

*Expect to learn the basics of r, and to be able to use r more independently in the future instead of SPSS. Basic understanding of coding, its possibilities and utilities for work/personal life.*

**Where did you hear about the course?**

*My Brother messaged me about this course and said it could be useful and interesting. I work full time and I'm also doing my thesis. To this point I have been using SPSS, but maybe I can try some analysis with r aswell for the data.*
